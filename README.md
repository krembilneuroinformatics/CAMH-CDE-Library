# CAMH Common Data Elements

The following assesments are part of the CAMH CDE Library. These assessments are used in CAMH's clinical instance of REDCap ("Clinical REDCap") as part of the BrainHealth Databank intiative to promote standardized measurement based care across the hospital.

Each assesment includes a reference PDF and a REDCap CSV data dictionary. Instrument CSV files can be downloaded and uploaded into a REDCap project. To upload an assessment into REDCap:
1. Dowload the CSV file. Be sure to check the [CDE Library index](https://public.tableau.com/profile/steve.hawley#!/vizhome/cde-library-index/Dashboard1) for important version notes and/or terms of use.
1. Rename the file to **instrument.csv**
1. ZIP the file
1. Upload to your REDCap project

**Note that each instrument has been designed and clinically validated for institutional standardization. Any modifications to the design of these instruments may result in unintended data quality issues that preclude downstream analyses.**
